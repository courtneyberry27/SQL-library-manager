# SQL-library-manager
This is a library manager app that uses SQL to create, read, update, and delete data in the database. This app also features search and pagination components. I have customized the entire color scheme to make it more visually appealing.

To run: 1.)download code and open in text editor 2.)make sure you have node and npm installed and run npm install 3.)start the app by running npm start 4.)open localhost:3000 to view and use
